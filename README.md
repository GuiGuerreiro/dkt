# Distributed key table
[ACADEMIC]

My "Internet and Computer Networks" project, part of the Eletrical and Computer Engineering Msc at Instituto Superior TÃ©cnico.

The objective of the project was to implement a dynamic server ring, making use of TCP and UDP protocols.
The server ring is able to accept new incoming servers that wish to join, be able to deal with expected and unexpected server leaves and crashes and is also able to search the ring for a certain key location.
Not much security and input validation was implemented given it was not a project requirement.
